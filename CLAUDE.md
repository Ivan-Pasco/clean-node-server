# CLAUDE.md - Clean Node Server Development Guide

This file provides guidance when working with the Clean Node Server codebase.

## Project Overview

Clean Node Server provides a Node.js-based runtime for Clean Language WebAssembly applications.

## Important Constraints

- **NEVER** write any reference to AI assistants in any documents, git commits, or any part of the code
- **NEVER** mention AI tools in git commit messages or any part of the codebase

## Cross-Component Work Policy

**CRITICAL: AI Instance Separation of Concerns**

When working in this component and discovering errors, bugs, or required changes in **another component** (different folder in the Clean Language project), you must **NOT** directly fix or modify code in that other component.

Instead:

1. **Document the issue** by creating a prompt/task description
2. **Save the prompt** in a file that can be executed by the AI instance working in the correct folder
3. **Location for cross-component prompts**: Save prompts in `../system-documents/cross-component-prompts/` at the project root

### Prompt Format for Cross-Component Issues

```
Component: [target component name, e.g., clean-language-compiler]
Issue Type: [bug/feature/enhancement/compatibility]
Priority: [critical/high/medium/low]
Description: [Detailed description of the issue discovered]
Context: [Why this was discovered while working in the current component]
Suggested Fix: [If known, describe the potential solution]
Files Affected: [List of files in the target component that need changes]
```

### Why This Rule Exists

- Each component has its own context, dependencies, and testing requirements
- AI instances are optimized for their specific component's codebase
- Cross-component changes without proper context can introduce bugs
- This maintains clear boundaries and accountability
- Ensures changes are properly tested in the target component's environment

### What You CAN Do

- Read files from other components to understand interfaces
- Document compatibility issues found
- Create detailed prompts for the correct AI instance
- Update your component to work with existing interfaces

### What You MUST NOT Do

- Directly edit code in other components
- Make changes to other components' configuration files
- Modify shared resources without coordination
- Skip the prompt creation step for cross-component issues
